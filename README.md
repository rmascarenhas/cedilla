# cedilla.js

An implementation of the [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) library.

### Usage

The functions follow exactly the same signatures and behavior of the original
library.

### Status

Incomplete. Not all functions are implemented and it is not as good as the
original library as well, of course. Built with the purpose of learning
JavaScript and reading the well-written underscore.js code.

### License
